A short attempt at making an aMAZIng game!!!

# The Maze Project
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to The Maze Project - a 3D Maze game that uses ray casting to render a 2D map into a 3D navigable world. But let's talk about what really sets this game apart: the use of the SDL2 library.

But we're not just using SDL2 because it's cool (even though it is). We're committed to exploring what this incredible library has to offer and using its features to elevate The Maze Project to the next level. From enhancing audio and graphics to optimizing input and controls, every aspect of the game will benefit from the power of SDL2.

Of course, like any game, The Maze Project has its flaws. But we're not afraid to address them head-on and take the necessary steps to make the game even better. We believe that SDL2 holds the key to unlocking the game's full potential, and we can't wait to see what we can accomplish when we fully tap into its capabilities.

### About SDL2 

SDL2, also known as the Simple DirectMedia Layer, is a cross-platform development library that offers unparalleled low-level access to various hardware components, such as audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. This allows developers, like yourself and if you may grace me the honour,myself too, to create top-notch games like The Maze Project, with precise control over every aspect of the game's functionality and performance.

## Instalation 
So, whether you're a seasoned developer or someone who's just curious about the inner workings of game development, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey of exploration and improvement with SDL2. Together, we can make The Maze Project a game that truly stands out, and one that we can all be proud of.

Thank you for your time and interest, and we hope to see you soon inside The Maze.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Methieg/Maze_Project_for_ALXv00.git
```
## Usage 
To play The Maze Project game, execute the ./maze file or run the command make run. You can use the up and down arrow keys (or the 'w' and 's' keys) to move forward and backward, and utilize the right and left arrow keys (or the 'd' and 'a' keys) to turn the camera around.

## Compilation
To compile The Maze Project, use the following command:

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic ./src/*.c -lm -o maze `sdl2-config --cflags` `sdl2-config --libs`
